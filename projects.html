                            This is a customer churn analysis of Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on Forage Job Sim.
                            The data is based on BCG's client - PowerCo, a energey provider for small to medium-sized enterprises,
                            and it is encoded to ensure data privacy.
                            The analysis provides insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn, constructs a random forest model with 85% of accuracy rate
                            in predicting customer churn, and suggests strategies to reduce customer churn.
