                        Hello, my name is Tzuying, a passionate statistics graduate from University of Toronto with a strong foundation in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving.
                        My journey in data began with my degree, where I developed skills in statistical modeling, data wrangling, and programming languages like Python, R, and SQL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to transform complex datasets into actionable insights. 
                        Over the past few years, I've been honing my skills through various projects, including 
                        “BCG Churning Analysis”, “eCommerce customer cohort analysis”, “Classifications of credit default”, and more. 
                        These experiences have deepened my expertise in understanding business challenges and providing data-driven solutions, and prepared me for real-world challenges. 
                        On this website, you’ll find a showcase of my projects, where I’ve worked with datasets ranging from sales performance to predictive modeling. 
                        Each project reflects my dedication to detail, critical thinking, and commitment to delivering impactful results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the early stages of my career, I am exploring how my data skills can shape my future opportunities. 
                        In 2025, I am launching a project called “People Behind the Data”, aiming to connect with professionals working in data-related roles across various industries. 
                        Through these conversations, I hope to gain insights into the current landscape, challenges, and trends within each industry. 
                        My goal is not only to expand my own knowledge but also to provide valuable perspectives for others interested in entering the world of data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited to bring my analytical skills and experiences to a team where I can contribute to data-driven decisions. 
                        If you’re looking for a detail-oriented, adaptable, and self-motivated data analyst, I’d love to connect!
                    </p>
